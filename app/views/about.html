BeerCheer started as an effort to keep track of local beer deals in Arvada.
</p> 
<p>
We noticed that different stores had different prices on different beverages, so you could be sure
to get a good buy on New Belgium Trippel in one store and a better deal on Uinta Hop Nosh in another store.

At BeerCheer, we try to keep you informed on local variations in beer prices.
